# Powershell Scripts
Just various Powershell scripts that I've aggregated for Exchange Online (O365) and I'm still working on. Feel free to use any of them. If you improve or fix any of them, please let me know!

NOTE: I haven't touched these in a couple of years, so there's no telling if they still work. I do plan to update them one day.
